## The Recording

I captured this at Canal Street station around 2am. The subway platform has this constant low hum from the ventilation system, mixed with occasional distant train rumbles. I used a contact mic attached to one of the support columns to pick up the vibrations.

**Raw recording**: 30 seconds, mono, 48kHz

## Processing Chain

### 1. Initial Cleanup

First, I trim the recording to the cleanest 10-second loop and apply a subtle high-pass filter at 80Hz to remove unnecessary sub-bass rumble that muddies the mix.

```
EQ Eight:
- High-pass at 80Hz (12dB/oct)
- Slight boost at 200Hz (+2dB) to warm it up
```

### 2. Grain Delay Magic

This is where the texture comes alive. Ableton's Grain Delay is perfect for turning static recordings into evolving pads.

```
Grain Delay:
- Spray: 45ms
- Frequency: 0.35Hz
- Pitch: -7 semitones
- Dry/Wet: 70%
```

The negative pitch shift drops the subway hum into a pad register, while the spray parameter adds movement.

### 3. Reverb Layer

I send the grain delay output to a reverb return track to create depth.

```
Valhalla VintageVerb:
- Decay: 8 seconds
- Mix: 40%
- Pre-delay: 20ms
- Color: Dark
```

### 4. Final Polish

A compressor with slow attack to glue everything together, plus a bit of saturation for warmth.

## Result

What started as a noisy subway recording becomes a rich, evolving pad perfect for ambient breaks or transitions. The texture retains that "urban" quality but sits beautifully in a mix.

## Try This Yourself

Go out with a contact mic or even just your phone. Find structures that hum: HVAC units, bridges, metal railings. The key is finding sounds with consistent frequency content that grain delay can grab onto.

Don't overthink the recording quality—sometimes the noise floor becomes part of the texture.
