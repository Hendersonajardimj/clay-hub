## About This Release

**Concrete Frequencies** is an exploration of the sonic architecture found in urban construction sites. Each track was built from field recordings captured during late-night sessions around scaffolding, jackhammers, and the mechanical rhythm of city rebuilding.

The album bridges the gap between harsh industrial techno and the subtle textures of ambient music, creating a space where the city becomes the instrument.

### Track List

1. Rebar Dreams (6:32)
2. Scaffold Patterns (5:47)
3. Foundation (7:15)
4. Load Bearing (6:03)
5. Transit Hum (8:21)
6. Green Awning (5:54)

### Production Notes

All percussion stems were derived from contact mic recordings of construction materials. The signature "clang" sound throughout the album is a steel beam hit at different points, processed through granular synthesis and layered with reverb sends.
